# All-wheel-for-Python-tensorflow
I am providing all .whl files for your convenience to install tensorflow in Python.

As you may have a hard time installing qualified tensorflow on your machine. (Well, I did.) 
These are all .whl files you may need to install in command line before you install the tensorflow. 

Prerequisite: Anaconda
>> Create a file folder in your computer
>> Download all files I provided here
>> Put all files into that folder
>> [Windows] hold 'shift' + right click in the folder, click open in the command line
>> [Command Line] type in 'pip install (.whl file name)'
>>    do this for multiple times until you have installed all those .whl files in your machine
>>    The second last .whl your may install is "tensorboard-1.14......"
>>    The last .whl you need to install is "tensorflow-1.14......"


Hope these work!
Good luck in your all Data Science, Machine Learning, AI, or NLP works!
