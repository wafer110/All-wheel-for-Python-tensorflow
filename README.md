# All-wheel-for-Python-tensorflow
If you want to run tensorflow package on your machine (through anaconda), you might have be able to install it through Anaconda. 
However, my machine was having trouble with installing the tensorflow.
I finally installed if all by my self with getting all required .whl/tar files.

Therefore, I would like to provide all .whl files for your convenience to install tensorflow in Python.
Below are all .whl files you may need to install in command line before you install the tensorflow. 

Prerequisite: Anaconda
> Create a file folder in your computer

> Download all files I provided here

> Put all files into that folder

> [Windows] hold 'shift' + right click in the folder, click open in the command line

> [Command Line] type in 'pip install (.whl file name)'

>    do this for multiple times until you have installed all those .whl files in your machine

>    The second last .whl your may install is "tensorboard-1.14......"

>    The last .whl you need to install is "tensorflow-1.14......"


Hope these work!  
Good luck in your all Data Science, Machine Learning, AI, NLP, or whatever works!
